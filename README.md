# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Library

A Bash and JavaScript library containing useful functions to write native applications interacting with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

The library depends on
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash),
[EVM Chains Info](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-info),
[EVM Chains Explorers](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-explorers),
the
[EVM Contracts Tools](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contract-tools)
and it is supposed to be used with
[EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet)
and
[Solidity Compiler](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/solidity-compiler).

The build reference tool for applications using the library
is
[EVM Make](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-make).

Together with the aforementioned applications
as well as others, libEVM makes up the EVM Toolchain.

EVM stands for *Ethereum Virtual Machine*.

Significant applications developed using the library are
the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
(EVMFS), the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
uncensorable Life and DogeOS user repository
and application store and its reference
[pub](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/pub)
publishing tool and source retrieval tool
[aspe](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/aspe),
the
[EVM OpenPGP Key Server](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-openpgp-keyserver),
the uncensorable, undeletable, distributed, network-neutral,
decentralized Twitter (whose sources are entirely hosted on
the EVMFS) and many others currently in development.

LibEVM is a core component of the Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).

## Documentation

You can immediately start using this library into your Bash program by
pasting the following at its beginning:

```bash
_bin="$( \
  dirname \
    "$( \
      command \
        -v \
	  "env")")"
_lib="${_bin}/../lib"
source \
  "${_lib}/libevm/libevm"
```

For a Javascript program or library you can use a similarly styled
import:

```javascript
const
  _libevm_module =
    require(
      "../libevm/libevm-js");
```

While one could say documentation work is never really
complete for a program or library in active development,
a short manual can be consulted upon installation typing

```bash
man \
  libevm
```

It's currently suggested to look at existing programs
depending on the library to speed up the library usage
understanding.

## Installation

The library in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

LibEVM has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`libevm`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  libevm
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[libevm-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libevm-ur).

A censorable binary build for the GNU and Android bases of
Life and DogeOS, also compatible with the Arch Linux distribution
and the Termux pacman-based environment can be found on the
[Fur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur)
and it can be installed by typing

```bash
fur \
  libevm
```

Direct links to the binary package can be directly accessed
through
[Github](
https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur/tree/libevm)
web interface.

Be aware, differently than the Ur and EVMFS
sources, these mirrors could go offline any time
as Github and more in general all HTTP resources
are inherently unstable and censorable.
