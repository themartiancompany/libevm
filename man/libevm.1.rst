Synopsis

    _bin="$( \
      dirname \
        "$( \
          command \
            -v \

Description
===========

Bash and JavaScript library providing useful functions
to write native applications interacting with
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks.

The library depends on
`Crash Bash`_, `EVM Chains Info`_, `EVM Chains Explorers`_,
the `EVM Contracts Tools`_, and it is supposed to be used
with `EVM Wallet`_ and `Solidity Compiler`_.

The build reference tool for applications using the library
is `EVM Make`_.

The library, together with the aforementioned applications
as well as others makes up the EVM Toolchain.

EVM stands for *Ethereum Virtual Machine*.

Significant applications developed using the library are
the `Ethereum Virtual Machine File System`_ (EVMFS),
the `Ur`_ uncensorable Life and DogeOS user repository
and application store, its reference
`pub`_ publishing tool and source retrieval tool `aspe`_,
`EVM OpenPGP Key Server`_, the uncensorable, undeletable,
distributed, network-neutral, decentralized Twitter
(whose sources are entirely hosted on
the EVMFS) and many others currently in development.

LibEVM is a core component of the
Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).
