Synopsis
========


..  code-block:: bash

    _bin="$( \
      dirname \
        "$( \
          command \
            -v \

Description
===========

Bash and JavaScript library providing useful functions
to write native applications interacting with
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks.

The library depends on Crash Bash [1]_, EVM Chains Info [2]_,
EVM Chains Explorers [3]_, the EVM Contracts Tools [4]_,
and it is supposed to be used
with EVM Wallet [5]_ and Solidity Compiler [6]_.

The build reference tool for applications using the library
is EVM Make [7]_.

The library, together with the aforementioned applications
as well as others makes up the EVM Toolchain.

EVM stands for *Ethereum Virtual Machine*.

Significant applications developed using the library are
the Ethereum Virtual Machine File System (EVMFS) [8]_,
the Ur [9]_ uncensorable Life and DogeOS user repository
and application store, its reference
pub [10]_ publishing tool and source retrieval tool aspe [11]_,
EVM OpenPGP Key Server [12]_, the uncensorable, undeletable,
distributed, network-neutral, decentralized Twitter
(whose sources are entirely hosted on
the EVMFS) and many others currently in development.

LibEVM is a core component of the
Human Instrumentality Project (HIP).
